## ‚ú® Features
- **File Import:**  
  Import and store documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) in MongoDB using GridFS, enabling scalable storage and retrieval.
  
- **File Management:**  
  Manage documents by deleting or updating records in the database as needed.
  
- **Document Search:**  
  Perform efficient searches based on metadata (filename, upload date, modification date) and document content. Supports multi-condition combination searches.
  
- **Text Analysis:**  
  Automatically extract and display detailed metadata, including:
  - Word count
  - Character count
  - Page count
  
- **Document Similarity Comparison:**  
  Compare two documents using various similarity metrics:
  - Cosine Similarity
  - Jaccard Similarity
  - Euclidean Distance
  
- **User Interface:**  
  Provides an intuitive **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for seamless user interaction.
